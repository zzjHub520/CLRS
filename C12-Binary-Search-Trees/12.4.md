### Exercises 12.4-1
***
Prove equation (12.3).

### `Answer`
这是排列组合的基本性质，可以利用帕斯卡三角形去证明.

\mathrm{C}_n^k+\mathrm{C}_n^{k-1} = \mathrm{C}_{n+1}^{k})


### Exercises 12.4-2
***
Describe a binary search tree on n nodes such that the average depth of a node in the tree is Θ(lg n) but the height of the tree is w(lg n). Give an asymptotic upper bound on the height of an n-node binary search tree in which the average depth of a node is Θ(lg n).

### `Answer`
多检查一次是否相等.


### Exercises 12.3-3
***
We can sort a given set of n numbers by first building a binary search tree containing these numbers (using TREE-INSERT repeatedly to insert the numbers one by one) and then printing the numbers by an inorder tree walk. What are the worst-case and best-case running times for this sorting algorithm?

### `Answer`
退化成链表就是最坏情况.


### Exercises 12.3-4
Suppose that another data structure contains a pointer to a node y in a binary search tree, and suppose that y's predecessor z is deleted from the tree by the procedure TREE-DELETE. What problem can arise? How can TREE-DELETE be rewritten to solve this problem?
### `Answer`
当要删除的节点有两个子节点时，节点y会被删除. 如果指向的是节点y,那么就出问题的.在这种情况下应该修改成指向节点z.


### Exercises 12.3-5
***
Is the operation of deletion "commutative" in the sense that deleting x and then y from a binary search tree leaves the same tree as deleting y and then x? Argue why it is or give a counterexample.

### `Answer`
NO.

### Exercises 12.3-6
***
When node z in TREE-DELETE has two children, we could splice out its predecessor rather than its successor. Some have argued that a fair strategy, giving equal priority to predecessor and successor, yields better empirical performance. How might TREE-DELETE be changed to implement such a fair strategy?

### `Answer`

* 是不是可以随机选一个 - -
* 或者可以给每个节点维护一个高度属性，从高度高的那边拿.
